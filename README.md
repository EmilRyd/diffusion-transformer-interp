A short investigation into doing mech interp on diffusion transformers.

To run the code:
```
cd /path/to/your/local/working/directory
git clone https://github.com/EmilRyd/diffusion-transformer-interp.git
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

The experiments are in the notebook experiments.ipynb, which you can then run using the conda environment as your kernel.
