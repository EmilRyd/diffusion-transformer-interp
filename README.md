A short investigation into doing mech interp on diffusion transformers.

To run the code:
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/EmilRyd/diffusion-transformer-interp.git

# Navigate into the repository
cd diffusion-transformer-interp

# Create conda environment from the environment file
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate the environment
conda activate [environment-name]
```

The experiments are in the notebook experiments.ipynb, which you can then run using the conda environment as your kernel.
